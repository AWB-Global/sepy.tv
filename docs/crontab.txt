There are two issues:

Crontab uses very limited PATH variables.
Crontab doesn’t use a display or terminal to run code. Everything runs in the background.
Initially, I was getting this error: “Message: ‘geckodriver’ executable needs to be in PATH.”

The fix for that is to add the PATH to the browser driver to the cronjob.

The second issue I ran into was the cronjob not having a display to use.

The fix for that is to add a Display to the cronjob command.

I set this up in Ubuntu 19.04 using crontab -e

Here is the end result:




* * * * * export DISPLAY=:0 && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin && /usr/bin/python3 /home/username/Documents/Project/project.py



This cron job will run every minute.
